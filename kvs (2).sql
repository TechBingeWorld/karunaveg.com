If answer to all these questions is no then for sure you are herbivores believe it or not. \r\n                <br>If you see our body structure, humans have soft fingertips with small nails and canine unit. In comparison carnivores have large canine teeth to tear flesh from body.

Strong acids have no role to play while digesting properly chewed food, fruits and vegetables.\r\n                If we look at our ancestors, they had meat eating habits but that was in absence of green products. Our meat-eating habits developed by scavenging and eating left overs of other carnivores.

There\'s no limit to consuming junk food and packed drinks. So companies use harmful colors, sodium nitrate, high Frutos, poor quality corn syrup, and oil to make these products delicious and fresh. We consume these products for a long time that\'s why the body\'s resistance becomes low. I will give you an example in old times farmers use 1 Quilton of wheat seeds and it produces 3 to 5 max Quilton of wheat. It Quality is full of nutrients and protein. But today period of time they use various kinds of chemicals and pesticides that if we use 1 Quilton of wheat, it produces 25 to 30 Quilton of wheat like 10 times from before so it decreases the quality and people suffer.

We can reject speciesism and act with integrity and consistency toward all living beings, and the first step is to recognize that every animal has the right to live free from human exploitation.\r\nVegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br> In the end, our main Agenda is to Encourage people to become Vegan, or at the very least, Vegetarian.', '', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiJKbXZrgts', 0, '2022-07-17 12:38:28'),

(13, 'What If Everyone Becomes Vegetarian In this World!', 'They started by looking at climate change. One-quarter to one-third of all co2 emissions globally are attributed to the production of food, with the cattle sector bearing the lion\'s share of the blame. Despite this, the impact of our eating habits on climate change is frequently overlooked. For instance, a typical family of four in the US produces more greenhouse gases due to their consumption of meat, which is frequently brought up in conversations about global warming.\r\nTim Benton, a food security specialist at the University of Leeds, claims that \"the majority of people don\'t think of the significance of food on climate change.\" But even a little reduction in meat consumption might significantly improve conditions for our children and grandchildren.\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would occur if by 2050 everyone adopted a vegetarian diet?. According to the findings, food-related emissions would decrease by around 60% as a result of eliminating red meat. Instead, if everyone became vegan, emissions would fall by about 70%.\r\n\"We found that you could only stabilise the ratio of food-related emissions to all emissions if everyone adopted a plant-based diet,\" Springmann adds. \"When looking at what would be in accordance with avoiding hazardous levels of climate change.\" \"That scenario is not very likely, but it emphasises the significance of emissions related to food in the future.\"\r\nFood, especially cattle, takes up a lot of space and is a source of biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and land conversion. Around five billion hectares (12 billion acres) of agricultural land are used for cattle worldwide.\r\nIf everyone became a vegetarian, we should ideally devote at least 80% of that pastureland to the restoration of grasslands and woodlands, which would help slow down climate change by capturing carbon. Former pastures might be turned into natural habitats, which would certainly benefit biodiversity as well as huge herbivores like buffalo that were driven out by cattle and predators like wolves that are sometimes killed in reprisal for attacking livestock.\r\n<br>\r\nTo make up for any gaps in the food supply, the remaining 10 to 20 percent of the previous pastureland may be used to grow more crops. Because one-third of the area currently utilised for crops is devoted to providing food for livestockâ€”rather than for humansâ€”rather than for humans, this relatively little increase in agricultural land would more than make up for the loss of meat.\r\n<br>\r\nIf everyone becomes vegetarian by 2050, coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and several malignancies would decline, resulting in a 6â€“10% decrease in global mortality. Half of that drop is attributable to eliminating red meat, with the remaining advantages coming from reducing calorie intake and boosting fruit and vegetable consumption. These advantages would be amplified further by a global vegan diet: while vegetarianism would prevent roughly 7 million deaths annually, veganism would prevent up to 8 million. A reduction in the number of persons with chronic food-related disorders would also result in lower medical costs, saving around 2% to 3% of the world\'s GDP.\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Veganism has more benefits than Non Veg for your Health and as well as for our Global Warming', '', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfCdgOfJ2oE', 0, '2022-08-04 08:35:47'),
(14, 'Healthy Food is Equal to Healthy Life', 'A healthy diet includes the following:\r\nFruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, such as lentils and beans (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).\r\na minimum of 400 g (five pieces), or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day, omitting starchy roots like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cassava.\r\nLess than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars, which is equal to 50 g (or around 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, is recommended for additional health benefits. However, less than 5% of total energy intake is preferable. All added sugars to food or beverages, whether by the producer, cook, or consumer, as well as sugars found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit juice concentrates, are considered free sugars.\r\n30 percent or less of total energy intake from fats . Saturated fats, which are present in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee, and lard, as well as trans-fats of all kinds, including ruminant trans-fats, are to be avoided. These fats can also be found in baked and fried foods, as well as in pre-packaged snacks and foods like frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). Saturated fat intake should be kept to less than 10% of total energy intake, and trans fat intake should be kept to less than 1% of total calorie intake, according to recommendations. Trans-fats manufactured industrially, in particular, do not belong in a healthy diet and should be avoided .\r\nLess than 5  g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day.  Salt should be iodized.\r\n<br>\r\nVeggies and fruits\r\nIn addition to lowering the risk of NCDs, eating at least 400 g, or five pieces, of fruit and vegetables each day helps to ensure that one gets enough dietary fibre each day.\r\nBy constantly adding vegetables in meals, snacking on fresh fruit and raw vegetables, eating fruit and vegetables that are in season, and eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, one can increase their intake of fruits and vegetables.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Second International Conference on Nutrition was convened by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in November 2014. (ICN2). ICN2 approved the Framework for Action (18) and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition (17), which suggest a number of policy alternatives and measures to support varied, secure, and healthy meals at all stages of life.
